Minimalitic `find` using breadth first crawling.

The entire invocation syntax is:

    bfind [--xdev] [--hardlinks] [--symlinks] \
          [--visible] [--print0] [--] DIRECTORY

With --xdev crawling will not be restricted to
one mount point.

With --hardlinks bfind will be hardlink aware
on directories.

With --symlinks bfind will visit directories
symlinks points, and directories will never
be revisited. Visited directories will be
memorised by absolute real path name.

With --visible not files starting with a dot
will be listed.


Short option alternatives:

    -x --xdev
    -h --hardlinks
    -s --symlinks
    -v --visible
    -0 --print0

    Short options can be combined


Each link will always start with DIRECTORY.


Why bfind? While bfind is not as fast as find,
it will probably give your results faster if
you are looking for a file (not list files),
becuase the file you are looking for is probably
near the directory you are searching from.
