Minimalitic `find` using breadth first crawling.

The entire invocation syntax is:

    bfind [--xdev] [--hardlinks] [--symlinks] [--] DIRECTORY

With --xdev crawling will not be restricted to
one mount point.

With --hardlinks bfind will be hardlink aware
on directories.

With --symlinks, bfind will visit directories
symlinks points, and directories will never
be revisited. Visited directories will be
memorised by absolute real path name.


Short option alternatives:

    -x --xdev
    -h --hardlinks
    -s --symlinks

    Short options can be combined


Each link will always start with DIRECTORY.
