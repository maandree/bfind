Minimalitic `find` using breadth-first crawling.

The entire invocation syntax is:

    bfind [--xdev] [--hardlinks] [--symlinks] \
          [--visible] [--print0] [--] [DIRECTORY]

With --xdev crawling will not be restricted to
one mount point.

With --hardlinks bfind will be hardlink aware
on directories.

With --symlinks bfind will visit directories
symlinks points, and directories will never
be revisited. Visited directories will be
memorised by absolute real path name.

With --visible no files starting with a dot
will be listed.

With --print0 a NUL (\0) character will be
printed at end of file names rather than
a LF (\n).


Short option alternatives:

    -x --xdev
    -h --hardlinks
    -s --symlinks
    -v --visible
    -0 --print0

    Short options can be combined


Each line will always start with DIRECTORY.


Why bfind? While bfind is not as fast as find*,
it will probably give your results faster if
you are looking for a file (not list files),
becuase the file you are looking for is probably
near the directory you are searching from.


* For large hierarchies.
