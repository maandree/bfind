NAME
	bfind - Minimalitic find using breadth-first crawling

SYNOPSIS
	bfind [OPTION]... [--] [DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION
	bfind is a minimalitic alternative to find(1) that is
	designed to be efficient that locating files. To
	accomplish this, bfind uses breadth-first crawling
	instead of depth-first crawling.

	bfind is only includes the bare minimum, a few options
	for restricting the crawlspace and an option to output
	visited files in a safe format rather than a human-friendly
	format. bfind will never include all features of find(1)
	because they are excessive and some other than makes not
	since to have in the program and can be outright dangerous.

OPTIONS
	-x, --xdev
		Do not restrict crawling to one mount point.

	-h, --hardlinks
		Watch out for hardlinked directories.

	-s, --symlinks
		Visit symbolically linked directories, but
		never visit the same directory twice.

	-v, --visible
		No files starting with a dot will be listed.

	-0, --print0
		Terminate lines with NUL rather than LF.

RATIONALE
	While bfind is not as fast as find(1) for large
	hierarchies, it will probably give your results faster
	if you are looking for a file (rather than listing files),
	because the file you are looking for is probably
	near the directory you are searching from.

SEE ALSO
	find(1), grep(1)
